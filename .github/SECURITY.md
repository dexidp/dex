# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, send an email to [cncf-dex-maintainers@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-dex-maintainers@lists.cncf.io)
detailing the issue and steps to reproduce. The reporter(s) can expect a
response within 48 hours acknowledging the issue was received. If a response is
not received within 48 hours, please reach out to any maintainer directly
to confirm receipt of the issue.

## Review Process

Once a maintainer has confirmed the relevance of the report, a draft security
advisory will be created on GitHub. The draft advisory will be used to discuss
the issue with maintainers, the reporter(s).
If the reporter(s) wishes to participate in this discussion, then provide
reporter GitHub username(s) to be invited to the discussion. If the reporter(s)
does not wish to participate directly in the discussion, then the reporter(s)
can request to be updated regularly via email.

If the vulnerability is accepted, a timeline for developing a patch, public
disclosure, and patch release will be determined. The reporter(s) are expected
to participate in the discussion of the timeline and abide by agreed upon dates
for public disclosure.
