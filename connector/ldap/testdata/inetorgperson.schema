# `content' field.  Values of this attribute contain a person's entire
# certificate chain and an smimeCapabilities field [RFC2633] that at a
# minimum describes their SMIME algorithm capabilities.  Values for
# this attribute are to be stored and requested in binary form, as
# 'userSMIMECertificate;binary'.  If available, this attribute is
# preferred over the userCertificate attribute for S/MIME applications.
